## Context
- Ultimate Goal: Implement End to End Event Analysis Engine.
- Tools: Phoenix Live View, Postgresql, Oban.
- Each agent will be given a git worktree to do work in on their own git branches. Agents make changes exclusively within their starting directories.
- Work will be considered complete when the output files and only the output and target files have code representitive of the tasks given to them.
- commit changes with a descriptive and short message and push changes up to remote origin
- If you are unsure ask questions before writing code.

Below are separate objectives for each agent to work on. Agents will only work on their given tasks.

## Agent: amp-one
**Scope**
- Setup create, find, find_all, update, delete functions for the runs table that we now have

**Tasks**
- read ecto schema files for runs
- create create, find, find_all, update, delete functions for runs
- add useful tests for created functions in runs_test, along with fixtures for easier tests in future

**Expected Outputs**
- `amp-one/apps/simple_elixir_server/lib/simple_elixir_server/runs.ex`
- `amp-one/apps/simple_elixir_server/test/simple_elixir_server/runs_test.exs`
